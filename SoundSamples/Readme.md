Here are some sound samples of TeensyDist models. 

The signal path is simply: guitar -> TeensyDist -> audion interface -> PC -> Cabinet simulator (Catharsis S-pres8 impulse) & Reverb (Zita Rev) in Guitarix => Audacity for recording

Sample 1: Guitar is a LP style guitar with humbucker (Harley Benton SC450+)

Sample 2: Guitar is a ST style guitar with single coil (Harley Benton ST62)
Note: As I play right in front of the electric supply cabinet of my house, there is quite a bit of 50Hz hum captured by the single coil pickups here.

In both samples, the first model corresponds to a "Tweed" style clean, followed by British style crunch and two higher gain sounds.

Please excuse the sloppy playing, I am not a great guitar player ;-)
